I graduated in statistics at the University of Genoa in December 2014, this repo contains the slides created for the final presentation.
The title of the thesis is "Adaboost multivariate", the slides were produced from a LateX file, it can help having different formulas, its own layout and logic for slide management.

In the repo there is also a pdf file that shows what is produced by the LateX file.
